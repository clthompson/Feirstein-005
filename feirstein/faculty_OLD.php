					<h5>Alrick Brown, Producing, Directing</h5>
					<p>Recognized as one of <em>Filmmaker Magazine</em>&rsquo;s 25 New Faces to Watch (2011), Alrick Brown is an award-winning writer and director. His collective works have screened in more than 65 festivals worldwide, earning numerous awards and honors. Among them is the HBO Life Through Your Lens Emerging Filmmaker Award for the critically acclaimed documentary <em>Death of Two Sons</em>, which he produced. In 2004 he was one of four NYU students featured in the IFC Documentary series <em>Film School,</em> produced by Academy Award–nominee Nannette Burstein.</p>
					<p>His first feature, <em>Kinyarwanda</em>, made its world premiere as recipient of the prestigious World Cinema Audience Award at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Since then, <em>Kinyarwanda</em> has screened internationally in more than 20 festivals, adding over a half dozen honors to the writer/director&rsquo;s credits, including making Roger Ebert&rsquo;s top 10 list of 2011.</p>
					<p>Brown made his small screen debut directing an episode of ABC&rsquo;s <em>Final Witness</em>, which aired in July 2012. Recently, he made his television-writing debut penning and producing two episodes of Investigative Discoveries Emmy Award–winning series <em>A Crime to Remember</em> that aired in fall 2014.  </p>
					<p>Brown began his career as an educator but found his true calling after visiting the slave castle of Elmina, in Ghana, during two years of service with the Peace Corps in Cote d'Ivoire. The interactions with the people of his village, and his overall experiences in West Africa, informed his creative expression, an expression first fostered by his birth in Kingston, Jamaica, and migration to, and upbringing in, Plainfield, N.J. </p>
					<p>Since then, his work has been described as cinematic archaeology because of his vision to unearth stories that otherwise would not be told. His commitment to revealing the heart of and world around a story is what draws audiences, peers and clients to his work.</p>
					<p>Brown graduated with a B.A. in English and a master&rsquo;s of education from Rutgers University, where he has taught undergraduate courses on the African American image in cinema. He received his M.F.A. from NYU&rsquo;s Tisch School of the Arts, where he later taught various courses to both undergraduate and graduate film students.</p>

His first feature film as a screenwriter, <em>Mejor es que Gabriela no se muera </em>was part of the official selection of AFI FEST, Guadalajara and São Paulo, among others, and won the award for Best First Feature at Cinequest in 2008. As a writer for Venezuela&rsquo;s RCTV (then one of the leading content producers in Latin America), he worked as creator and head writer of telenovelas and TV series including <em>Tukiti, I Grew up</em>, which was a semifinalist for the International Emmys in 2007 in the Children and Young People category. During that same period he also taught screenwriting at the Universidad Central de Venezuela as an adjunct professor.</p>

					<h5>Howard Rosenman, Producing</h5>
					<p>Howard Rosenman has established himself as one of the most prolific producers in film and television. Rosenman is best known for the remake of <em>Father of the Bride</em> (starring Steve Martin and Diane Keaton), Joss Whedon&rsquo;s cult phenomenon <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and <em>The Family Man</em> (starring Nicolas Cage). His films have won two Peabody Awards, an Academy Award, and top honors at the Sundance, Berlin and Cannes film festivals. With 30 films to date, Rosenman&rsquo;s work ranges from such popular favorites as <em>The Main Event</em> (starring Barbra Streisand), <em>A Stranger Among Us</em> (starring Melanie Griffith), and <em>You Kill Me</em> (starring Sir Ben Kingsley), to the acclaimed documentaries <em>The Celluloid Closet</em> and the Oscar- and Peabody-winning <em>Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt</em>, to the television series <em>John From Cincinnati</em> (HBO). Rosenman remade his first film, <em>Sparkle</em>, for Sony Pictures, directed by Salim Akil and starring the late Whitney Houston.</p>
					<p>Recently, he produced his fifth documentary, <em>Brave Miss World</em>, about the rape of Linor Abargil, who was Miss Israel and then Miss World, directed by Cecilia Peck, which has been sold to Netflix. He sold a six-hour miniseries to David Ellison&rsquo;s Skydance TV based on Michael Oren&rsquo;s book <em>Six Days of War,</em> with Rob Eshman and Todd Ellis Kessler writing. He sold a series to Amazon based on Richard Blanco&rsquo;s memoir <em>The Prince of Los Cocuyos</em> (Dan Bucatinsky is the writer and show runner, and his partners are Skydance TV and Paula Mazur) and a movie to Fox Broadcasting Company, a modern-day retelling of Charles Dickens&rsquo; <em>A Christmas Carol</em> called <em>Ebeneazah,</em> (Suzanne De Passe, producing partner; teleplay by Madison Jones; starring Taraji P. Henson as Scrooge and Wendy Williams as the ghosts).</p>
					<p>Currently, he is preparing a remake of Israel&rsquo;s most successful comedy, <em>Matter of Size</em>, at Paramount, to be directed by Jon Turteltaub; <em>Shepherd: A Tale of a Dog in World War II</em>, based on the best-selling Israeli novel, with Lynn Roth writing and directing; and a Broadway musical, Anne Rice&rsquo;s <em>Voce</em>, written by Maria Dahvana Headley, with music by Lance Horne.

He has acquired the rights to <em>The Hornes</em>, by Gail Buckley, and is co-producing (with Amy Lumet) a movie about Lena Horne to star Alicia Keys. This summer he and Peter Spears are producing <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>, to be presented by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino.</p>
					<p>Rosenman made his acting debut opposite Oscar-winning Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s <em>Milk,</em> in the role of David Goodstein, and has since appeared in five more movies.</p>
					<p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, Rosenman is the son of seventh-generation Israelis from Jerusalem. He graduated magna cum laude from Brooklyn College with a degree in European literature. In 1967, he took a leave from medical school to serve as an extern medic in the Six-Day War as part of the Israel Defense Forces. There, he met his mentor, Leonard Bernstein, who encouraged him to go into show business. In 1989, he co-founded Project Angel Food, a lifeline to people affected by HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. He was recently honored by the film organization POWER UP as &ldquo;one of this year&rsquo;s ten most amazing men in show business,&rdquo; and in 2014, he received the Humanitarian Award from the first LGBT synagogue in the world, Beth Chayim Chadashim in Los Angeles.</p>
					<p>Several years ago, Rosenman became a contributing editor of the <em>Los Angeles Times Magazine</em>, and he has penned articles about his longtime friendships with Bernstein, Elizabeth Taylor, and Diane von Furstenberg. As an educator, Rosenman was an adjunct professor at USC, where he lectured at the Stark Producing Program; he has also lectured at UCLA, Yale, Columbia, NYU, Brandeis, and AFI.</p>
					<p>Rosenman tours the world with his seminar &ldquo;Howard Rosenman&rsquo;s The Hollywood Sell,&rdquo; an inside look at producing for the screen in which he shares his insights and adventures with writers, actors, directors, producers, and anyone who loves film and TV. He has presented the seminar in Memphis, Tennessee; Omaha, Nebraska; Philadelphia; Boston; New York; and Los Angeles, with upcoming engagements in Seattle; Austin, Texas; San Francisco; South Africa; and Israel. He is currently at work on his first book, also entitled <em>The Hollywood Sell</em>, which will be both a memoir and a how-to-produce guide for aspiring filmmakers.</p>
