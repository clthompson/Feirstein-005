					<h5>Requirements for Application for M.A. in Cinema Studies</h5>
					<strong>Introduction</strong>
					<p>The M.A. in Cinema Studies Program provides a comprehensive education in cinema history, theory, criticism and aesthetics, and encourages the scholarly exploration of cinema as a form of art and a means of social communication. Students are required to complete a total of 36 credits, which may be pursued on either a full-time basis in two years or on a part-time basis. Because the degree program will be housed in the same facility as the M.F.A. in Cinema Arts Program (the Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard), students are able to deepen their knowledge within the context of a larger community of filmmakers and cinema scholars. The program’s interrelationship with the M.F.A. program and its connection to the film and media industries make it truly unique.</p>
					<p>The Office of Graduate Admissions manages applications to the M.A. in Cinema Studies. Only complete applications are forwarded to the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema.</p>
					<strong>Application Form</strong>
					<p><a href="http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/mediaarts/schools/feirstein/feirsteingraduateapplication.php" target="_blank">Apply online</a>. Supporting documents, such as official transcripts and essays, must be mailed to the Office of Graduate Admissions.</p>
					<strong>Application Fee</strong>
					<p>Pay the nonrefundable $125 application fee.</p>
					<strong>Transcripts</strong>
					<p>Submit transcripts from all universities and colleges attended.</p>
					<strong>International Transcript Credential Evaluation</strong>
					<p>Transcripts from institutions in another country must be evaluated by a professional agency that is a member of the <a href="http://www.naces.org/members.html" target="_blank">National Association of Credential Evaluation Services</a>. Evaluations must include a course-by-course analysis indicating the type of degree received, the U.S. equivalency of the degree, the graduation date and a cumulative grade point average.</p>
					<strong>Letters of Recommendation</strong>
					<p>Two letters of recommendation are required from individuals who can assess your potential for graduate study. Register your recommenders in the online application system so that they can submit their letters electronically.</p>
					<strong>Statement of Purpose</strong>
					<p>Write a three- to four-page (double-spaced, 12-point font) statement explaining your purpose in undertaking a graduate program in cinema studies. This is your opportunity to define your goals, interests and career plans as they relate to your proposed course of study. We are trying to gain a sense of who you are and the distinctive experiences and interests that have motivated you to pursue this degree.</p>
					<strong>Résumé/CV</strong>
					<p>Submit a copy of your résumé or CV including your education to date, employment and other relevant information.</p>
					<strong>GRE</strong>
					<p>The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is not required.</p>
					<strong>Writing Sample</strong>
					<p>Write a 12- to 15-page (double-spaced, 12-point font) sample essay that best exemplifies your research interests, your skills at conducting scholarly analysis (including the use of primary and secondary materials), and  your ability to write critically about cinema, television or other media; or submit a published article that fulfills these requirements. In the absence of either, an essay that critically examines a topic in the arts or humanities may be submitted provided that it meets the criteria listed above.</p>
					<strong>Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)</strong>
					<p>A <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl" target="_blank">TOEFL</a> score report is required from applicants whose first language is not English and who did not receive the equivalent of a four-year U.S. undergraduate education from an institution where English is the official language of instruction. We only accept TOEFL scores sent to us directly from Educational Testing Services (ETS). Our ETS Institution code is 2046. The minimum IBT score required for consideration is 100. We also accept the IELTS exam with score of 7.0 or higher.</p>
